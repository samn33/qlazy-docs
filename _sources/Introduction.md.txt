Quantum Computing Simulator

## Feature

- Simple quantum calculation using command line tool is possible.
- Quantum state operation or quantum circuit execution is possible with Python package.
- Support four types of quantum states: 1) quantum state vector, 2) density operator, 3) stabilizer state, 4) matrix product state.
- Other quantum computing services or simulators can be used as backend (followings are supported).
    - [qulacs](https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs)
    - [IBM Quantum(IBMQ)](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/)
    - [Amazon Braket(LocalSimulator,AWS,IonQ,Rigetti,OQC)](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/?nc1=h_ls)
- High-speed quantum circuit execution using GPU is possible (build from source code).

## Requirements

- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- Python 3.8
- numpy 1.21.0

Optional ...
- pyzx 0.7.0 (to use quantum circuit optimization with ZX-calculus)
- Qulacs 0.3.0 (to use qulacs backend)
- qiskit 0.37.0 (to use IBMQ backend)
- amazon-braket-sdk 1.25.2 (to use amazon braket backend)
- tensornetwork 0.4.6 (to use matrix product state simulation)
- cuda 11 (to use GPU version)
